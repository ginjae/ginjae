## 🌿 Hello, I'm Jaemin

I'm an undergraduate student who loves building things that feel simple, thoughtful, and a little bit human.  
Most of my work lives at the intersection of systems, AI, and the quiet joy of making something work better than before.

I’m learning, exploring, and growing—one small project at a time.  
Thanks for stopping by.
